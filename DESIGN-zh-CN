== 设计

* 简单来说: Unicorn 是一种传统的 UNIX prefork web 服务器.
  没用线程，这能让应用程序易于调试和维修。当你的应用程序出错，只需要 "kill -9" 即可解决失控的子进程，无需担心影响所有用户。只有 UNIX-like 的系统且支持 fork() 和文件句柄继承的才能支持.

* Ragel+C HTTP 解析器来自于 Mongrel。这里只有非 Ruby 的部分，并且没有计划增加其他非 Ruby 实现的组件。

* 所有 HTTP 解析以及 I/O 处理类似 Mongrel:
    1. 读取/解析完整的 HTTP Request headers
    2. 调用 Rack 应用程序
    3. 写 HTTP Response，返回给客户端

* 如同 Mongrel, 它也不支持 keepalive，也没有 pipelining.
  这是因为 Unicorn 是专为快速并且低延迟的客户端而设计。只做一件事情，并且把它做好，慢客户端让 Nginx 处理。

* 配置文件是 Ruby 预发。Ruby 会在 before_fork/after_fork/before_exec hooks 这类需要 lambdas 的时候表现更佳清晰。一个可选的，独立的配置文件用于修改配置信息。 (and also gives you plenty of rope if you RTFS
  :>)

* 一个 Master 进程管理多个子进程。Rack 应用程序只会被子进程调用（但它是能载入到 Master 进程里面的）。 可以用 "preload_app true" 来在 Ruby 2.0.0dev 以上或 REE 这些支持 copy-on-write friendly GC 的 Ruby 实现里面用来减少内存开销（详见 Unicorn::Configurator）。

* 子进程数量应该至少和 CPU 核数一样，如果内存允许的话。如果你已有一个 Mongrel cluster 部署单线程 App，可以用和之前一样的进程数量。把所有的 HTTP 请求交给像 Nginx 这样的反向代理软件来管理，解决 Slow client 的问题。Unicorn 的扩容取决于你后端的处理能力限制。

* 负载均衡有系统内核来实现。所有子进程共用一套非阻塞 socket, accept() 在上面。由系统内核来决定那个进程获得连接，那个该睡眠如果她没有接受内容的话。

* Since non-blocking accept() is used, there can be a thundering
  herd when an occasional client connects when application
  *is not busy*.  The thundering herd problem should not affect
  applications that are running all the time since worker processes
  will only select()/accept() outside of the application dispatch.

* Additionally, thundering herds are much smaller than with
  configurations using existing prefork servers.  Process counts should
  only be scaled to backend resources, _never_ to the number of expected
  clients like is typical with blocking prefork servers.  So while we've
  seen instances of popular prefork servers configured to run many
  hundreds of worker processes, Unicorn deployments are typically only
  2-4 processes per-core.

* On-demand scaling of worker processes never happens automatically.
  Again, Unicorn is concerned about scaling to backend limits and should
  never configured in a fashion where it could be waiting on slow
  clients.  For extremely rare circumstances, we provide TTIN and TTOU
  signal handlers to increment/decrement your process counts without
  reloading.  Think of it as driving a car with manual transmission:
  you have a lot more control if you know what you're doing.

* Blocking I/O is used for clients.  This allows a simpler code path
  to be followed within the Ruby interpreter and fewer syscalls.
  Applications that use threads continue to work if Unicorn
  is only serving LAN or localhost clients.

* SIGKILL is used to terminate the timed-out workers from misbehaving apps
  as reliably as possible on a UNIX system.  The default timeout is a
  generous 60 seconds (same default as in Mongrel).

* The poor performance of select() on large FD sets is avoided
  as few file descriptors are used in each worker.
  There should be no gain from moving to highly scalable but
  unportable event notification solutions for watching few
  file descriptors.

* If the master process dies unexpectedly for any reason,
  workers will notice within :timeout/2 seconds and follow
  the master to its death.

* There is never any explicit real-time dependency or communication
  between the worker processes nor to the master process.
  Synchronization is handled entirely by the OS kernel and shared
  resources are never accessed by the worker when it is servicing
  a client.
